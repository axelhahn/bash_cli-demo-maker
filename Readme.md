# Axels CLI demo maker

A bash script to present a set of commands as a pseudo terminal demo.

All your scripted commands will be typed wit a random delay followed by an interactive RETURN or given wait time.

You can customize a fake prompt (showing `user@tux-client (path) >` by default).

It is helpful:

* to show a few commands on a demo
* to combine it with tools like ttyrec to record cli commands
